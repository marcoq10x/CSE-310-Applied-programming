# Overview

Embarking on a journey to master C# and the fundamentals of programming, I developed a console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game. This project serves as a practical application of the core concepts such as object-oriented programming, control structures, data structures, and the basics of user interaction within a console application.

The software is a representation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, allowing two players to take turns to mark the spaces in a 3x3 grid. The objective of this project was to create a functional game from scratch, showcasing the capabilities of C# and my understanding of its syntax and constructs.

For a hands-on demonstration and a walkthrough of the code, explaining the intricacies of the C# language and what was learned during the process, check out the video below.

# Development Environment

The development of this game was carried out using Visual Studio Code, a powerful and versatile code editor that supports C# with the .NET 5.0 SDK. The .NET Core CLI was used for compiling and running the C# code, making it a streamlined experience to test and debug the game.

C# was chosen as the programming language due to its strong typing, object-oriented capabilities, and its widespread use in various fields of software development. No external libraries were required for this project, as all functionalities could be implemented using the standard .NET libraries.

# Useful Websites

Throughout the development of this game, I found the following websites incredibly helpful for learning C# and understanding best practices:

- [Microsoft C# Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/)
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/c%23)

These resources were invaluable for their comprehensive guides, community wisdom, and practical examples.

# Future Work

Looking ahead, there are several enhancements that could be made to the game:

- Implementing a GUI to replace the console-based interface.
- Adding a simple AI opponent for a single-player mode.
- Refining the player input process to be more fault-tolerant.

This project is just the beginning of a deep dive into C# and the principles of clean code and software design.
