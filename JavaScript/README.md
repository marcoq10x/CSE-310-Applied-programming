# Overview

As a passionate software engineer dedicated to continuous learning, I developed a currency exchange web application. This project reflects my exploration into JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, focusing on practical application and user interface design.

## Project Description

This software is an interactive web application designed to perform currency exchanges. It allows users to input an amount, select currencies to exchange from and to, and then displays the converted amount. The application is built using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for dynamic interactions and API integration.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project was to deepen my understanding of JavaScript language syntax and its application in web development. By creating this currency exchange application, I aimed to learn about handling user inputs, making API requests, and dynamically updating the Document Object Model (DOM).

# Development Environment

The application was developed using modern web development tools and technologies. I utilized Visual Studio Code as my primary code editor for its powerful features and extensions that support web development. The project is written in JavaScript, with no additional libraries, to focus on the core language features. HTML5 and CSS3 were used for structuring and styling the web interface.

# Useful Websites

During the development of this project, I found these websites particularly helpful:

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)

These resources provided comprehensive guides and examples on JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, which were invaluable for my learning and development process.

# Future Work

To enhance the application, I plan to address the following in future updates:

- Implementing real-time exchange rate updates.
- Adding more currencies and language support for broader user accessibility.
- Improving the user interface for a more engaging user experience.
